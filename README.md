# Portfolio Project: Python Terminal Game

This is a portfolio project for Codecademy's Computer Science path.

For this portfolio project, I will build a basic terminal version of **blackjack**. After I finish building the program, I will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of my choice.

## Rules of the game

I'm going to use a simple set of rules, as per this kids version of the game:

## Version 1

The initial version will have a simplified set of rules.

1. The game has one dealer and one player.
2. The goal is to have your cards total 21 or as close as possible without going over.
3. Number cards have their face value, picture cards have a value of 10. Aces are 11.
4. The dealer and player are dealt two cards. All cards are face up.
5. The player plays first.
6. The player must choose twist or stick.
7. If the player twists, the dealer gives the player another card. 
8. If the player's hand totals 21, the dealer shouts "Pontoon!" and the player wins.
9. If the player's hand is less than 21, they can twist again, or stick.
10. If the player's hand goes over 21, the dealer shouts "Bust!" and the dealer wins.
11. If the player sticks, the dealer runs through the same process of twisting or sticking until the dealer's total (a) beats the player's total or (b) goes bust. 
12. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.
13. If the dealer's hand beats the player's, the dealer sticks and wins.
