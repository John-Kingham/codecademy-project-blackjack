# Portfolio Project: Python Terminal Game

This is a portfolio project for Codecademy's Computer Science path.

## Project objectives

- Build a terminal program using Python
- Add at least one interactive feature using input()
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Write a technical blog post on the project

## Overview

To complete this project, I will build a basic terminal version of **blackjack**.

The game will follow a simplified set of blackjack rules:

- [x] The game will have one dealer (the computer) and one player.
- [x] The goal is to have your cards total 21 or as close as possible without going over.
- [x] Number cards have their face value, picture cards have a value of 10 and aces have a value of 11.
- [x] The dealer and player are dealt two cards. All cards are face up.
- [x] The player plays first.
- [x] The player must choose twist or stick.
- [x] If the player twists, the the player is given another card. 
- [x] If the player's hand totals 21, the dealer shouts "Pontoon!" and the player wins (I'm in the UK, and here blackjack is often called pontoon).
- [x] If the player's hand is less than 21, they can twist again, or stick.
- [x] If the player's hand goes over 21, the dealer shouts "Bust!" and the dealer wins.
- [x] If the player sticks, the dealer runs through the same process of twisting or sticking until the dealer's total either (a) beats the player's total or (b) goes bust. 
- [x] If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.
- [x] If the dealer's hand beats the player's, the dealer sticks and wins.
- [x] At the end of the game, the player is given the option to play again or quit
