# Portfolio Project: Python Terminal Game

This is a portfolio project for Codecademy's Computer Science path.

## Project objectives

- Build a terminal program using Python
- Add at least one interactive feature using input()
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Write a technical blog post on the project

## Overview

To complete this project, I will build a basic terminal version of **blackjack**.

The game will follow a simplified set of blackjack rules:

1. The game will have one dealer (the computer) and one player.
2. The goal is to have your cards total 21 or as close as possible without going over.
3. Number cards have their face value, picture cards have a value of 10 and aces have a value of 11.
4. The dealer and player are dealt two cards. All cards are face up.
5. The player plays first.
6. The player must choose twist or stick.
7. If the player twists, the the player is given another card. 
8. If the player's hand totals 21, the dealer shouts "Pontoon!" and the player wins (I'm in the UK, and here blackjack is often called pontoon).
9. If the player's hand is less than 21, they can twist again, or stick.
10. If the player's hand goes over 21, the dealer shouts "Bust!" and the dealer wins.
11. If the player sticks, the dealer runs through the same process of twisting or sticking until the dealer's total either (a) beats the player's total or (b) goes bust. 
12. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.
13. If the dealer's hand beats the player's, the dealer sticks and wins.
